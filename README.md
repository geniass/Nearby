# Nearby
Be reminded of Nearby places you would like to visit

## What is it?
In a foreign city you might have been only a couple of blocks away from a place on your itinierary, and only realised hours later.
Nearby solves this by loading places of interest from a custom [Google Map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/?hl=en_US&app=mp) and notifying you when you when you are close.

Currently it's very rough (you need to manually export KML files from My Maps) but it does work. And it has very little impact on battery life thanks to Google Play Service's Location API
